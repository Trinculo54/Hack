There’s a script included in this tweak that you can find in /Documents titled as DarkPapersScript. Inside the script folder you’ll find a tutorial on how to manually add your own day and night wallpapers to this package, in case you want to add your own custom wallpapers.

This tweak packages depends on WallpaperLoader in order to work. You can find the tweak in Skittyblock’s repository at:
https://skitty.xyz

All wallpapers included in this package are free to use. I do not own any rights above them and the credit goes to the original creators. The only changes made to these wallpapers by me were to tweak the darkness/color in some of them and to modify their original size.

Compatibility:
Compatible with iOS 13 or later. Not compatible with iPad devices.

Known Issues:
When previewing the wallpapers in the native settings app, the wallpapers may sometimes appear zoomed in but they won’t be zoomed in once you apply the wallpaper. A way to trigger this bug is to enable/disable the native dark mode when previewing the wallpapers.",
