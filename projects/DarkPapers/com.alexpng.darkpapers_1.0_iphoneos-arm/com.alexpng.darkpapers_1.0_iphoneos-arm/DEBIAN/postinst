|   A traditional chicken pie  is  | 
|   classic comfort food and this  |
|   fuss-free recipe is  one  you  |
|   will want to make over again.  |
|   It's  worth  making  your own  |
|   pastry if you can because the  |
|   ready made stuff just doesn't  |
|   match   up  to  the   buttery  |
|   loveliness    of    homemade.  |
